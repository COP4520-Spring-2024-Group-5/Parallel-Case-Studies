# Parallel Case Studies

## Topic 1: Investigating Parallel Programming Techniques in Video Game Development: Case Studies and Performance Analysis
Video game development is a demanding field that requires high levels of performance, responsiveness, and scalability.
Parallel programming techniques offer significant potential for optimizing game engines and enhancing player experiences.
This research project seeks to explore and analyze parallel programming methodologies through case studies of video game development.

## Topic 2: Understanding Parallel Programming for Case Studies and Performance Analysis
The objective of this research endeavor is to delve into the intricacies of parallel programming within the context of video game development.
By conducting case studies and performance analyses of select video game titles, we aim to unravel the underlying principles, strategies, and trade-offs associated with leveraging parallelism to enhance gaming experiences.

## Source Code Applicable
Since we are conducting case studies on parallel programming, we likely won't provide any source code developed by us.
Instead, we may decide to look at the usage of parallel programming in various places, such as video game development.
We also may include some details and visuals for the research opportunity we participated in.

## Challenges, Tasks, and Goals
### Challenges
- We all signed up for the research opportunity, but we also got scheduled in late Feburary and early March.
- We also lost a team member early on, which meant we needed to replan the distribution of work.

### Tasks
- Continue research on parallel programming usages in the real world.
- Discuss the research opportunity we all participated in.
- Write an abstract and introduction for the report.
- Write a concise problem statement for the report.
- Begin working on a presentation powerpoint slide.
- Add relevant source code and files to GitHub.

### Goals
- Complete a video presentation of our project by the presentation date. (Tuesday, March 26th)
- Complete the group project report by the submittal date. (Thursday, April 18th)
